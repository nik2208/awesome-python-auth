and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

#### AuthEventBus (mirrors awesome-node-auth)
- `AuthEventBus` — lightweight publish/subscribe bus for identity events.  Both sync and
  async handlers supported; wildcard topic `'*'` receives every event.
- `AuthEventNames` — standard event name constants following the `domain.resource.action`
  convention (`identity.auth.login.success`, `identity.user.created`, etc.).
- `AuthEventPayload` — type alias for the event dict published on the bus.
- `AuthTools` now accepts `event_bus: AuthEventBus` — `track()` automatically publishes
  every event onto the bus so external listeners (audit logs, analytics, etc.) can react
  without coupling to the auth flow.

#### Multi-channel `notify()` (mirrors awesome-node-auth >= 1.8.0)
- `AuthTools.notify()` now supports `channels` parameter: `'sse'` (default), `'email'`,
  and `'sms'`.
- `NotificationService` — thin facade wrapping `MailerService` and `SmsService` for
  transport-agnostic notifications.
- `SmsService` — HTTP GET SMS gateway client (mirrors `SmsService` from awesome-node-auth).
- `SmsConfig` — configuration dataclass for the SMS transport.
- `SendEmailOptions` / `SendSmsOptions` — options dataclasses for `NotificationService`.
- `AuthTools` now accepts `email_config: MailerConfig`, `sms_config: SmsConfig`, and
  `user_store: UserStore` to enable email and SMS notification channels.

#### Identity Provider (IdP) mode (mirrors awesome-node-auth)
- `IdProviderConfig` — dataclass that activates RS256/RSA-2048 IdP mode.  When set on
  `AuthConfig.id_provider`, the auth router signs JWTs with RS256 and exposes a public
  JWKS endpoint (`GET {api_prefix}/.well-known/jwks.json`).
- Auto-generation of an ephemeral RSA keypair for development (with a startup warning).
- `ResourceServerConfig` — dataclass that activates Resource Server mode.  When set on
  `AuthConfig.resource_server`, auth dependencies validate tokens against a remote JWKS
  URL instead of the local HS256 secret.
- `JwksService` — utility class for RSA keypair generation, PEM ↔ JWK conversion, and
  JWKS document building.
- `JwksClient` — async cached HTTP client for fetching remote JWKS endpoints (used by
  Resource Server mode).
- `JWK` — JWK data object.
- `jwt_utils`: new helpers `create_idp_access_token()`, `create_idp_refresh_token()`, and
  `decode_token_with_jwks()` for RS256 token creation and JWKS-based verification.
- `get_current_user`, `require_auth`, `require_roles` now automatically switch to
  JWKS-based RS256 verification when Resource Server mode is active.
